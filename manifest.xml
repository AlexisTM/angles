  <description brief='geometry_angles_utils'>
This package provides a set of simple math utilities to work
with angles. The utilities cover simple things like
normalizing an angle and conversion between degrees and
radians. But even if you're trying to calculate things like
the shortest angular distance between two joinst space
positions of your robot, but the joint motion is constrained
by joint limits, this package is what you need. The code in
this packge is stable and well tested. There are no plans for
major changes in the near future.
